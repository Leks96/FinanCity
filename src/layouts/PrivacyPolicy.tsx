      organizational, and technical safeguards that are designed to maintain the integrity and security of

      against any unauthorized use. While we seek to protect your information to ensure that it is kept
      confidential, we cannot absolutely guarantee its security. However, we do not store any passwords as an added
      layer of security. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and thus we cannot
